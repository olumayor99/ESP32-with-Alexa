# ESP32-with-Alexa
Code to connect ESP32 boards to Alexa using sinric.com
I have only tested this code with a WEMOS LOLIN32 board I got from Aliexpress, and it worked well.
Huge credits go to kakopappa for his repository here https://github.com/kakopappa/sinric. Without his guide, I would be lost.
I surfed the web for code examples to connect ESP32 boards to Alexa via sinric.com and I couldn't find any, so I wrote this piece by reading another guide on https://randomnerdtutorials.com/alexa-echo-with-esp32-and-esp8266/ , and I was able to pick a few things I needed.
I am not a guru, I'm a total beginner, but I'm very sure this code works pretty well.
